**ABOUT THE GAME**

RHEN is a pixel platformer game made with Python using the Pygame library. 
All characters, sprites and objects were made by myself using a free sprite editor, Piskel. 

The game development took about 2 years. The first file was created on 13th July 2022, moreover the finished, final version of the program was made on 28th June 2024.

**CONTROLS:**
- W,A,S,D - movement of the character
- Q - double jump
- E - dash
- SPACE - interacting
- 1-9 - inventory movement
- Scroll - inventory movement
- Left click - attacking

It was made for the resolution of 1920×1080 but the game was tested also on the resolution of 1536×864. Running the game with other resolution excluding the previously written ones can cause improper performance during the runtime.
